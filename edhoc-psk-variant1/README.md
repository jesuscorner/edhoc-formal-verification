# EDHOC PSK Variant 1 Formal Analysis

This directory contains a formal security analysis of EDHOC PSK authentication variant 1, as specified in `draft-lopez-lake-edhoc-psk-01` and based on RFC 9528.

## Overview

EDHOC PSK variant 1 is a pre-shared key authentication method for the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) protocol. The key characteristic of variant 1 is that the PSK credential identifier (`ID_CRED_PSK`) is sent in the clear in message_1, enabling early authentication but with privacy implications.

```

## Key Differences from Standard EDHOC

1. **PSK Authentication**: Uses pre-shared keys instead of signatures or certificates
2. **ID_CRED_PSK in Clear**: PSK identifier is sent unencrypted in message_1
3. **Modified Key Derivation**: Uses PSK in the key derivation process via `PRK_3e2m`
4. **Early Authentication**: Authentication starts from message_1 due to visible PSK ID

- `HeadersPSK.splib`: PSK-specific function definitions and helper functions

- `run-proverif-psk.sh`: Convert model and run ProVerif verification

### Results
- `results/`: Directory containing verification results and summaries

## Security Properties Analyzed

### Confidentiality
- **Forward Secrecy**: Past session keys remain secure even if PSK is later compromised
- **Session Key Secrecy**: Session keys are secure unless PSK is compromised or ephemeral shares are leaked
- **Key Independence**: Compromise of one session doesn't affect others

### Authentication
- **Mutual Authentication**: Both parties authenticate each other using the shared PSK
- **Injective Authentication**: Each protocol run corresponds to a unique partner session
- **Key Confirmation**: Parties confirm each other's knowledge of derived keys

### Additional Properties
- **Data Authentication**: Protocol messages and their contents are authenticated
- **Reflection Attack Resistance**: Protection against agents communicating with themselves
- **Session Key Agreement**: Both parties derive the same session keys

### Privacy Considerations
- **PSK Identity Exposure**: ID_CRED_PSK is visible to passive attackers in variant 1
- **Tracking Resistance**: Limited due to clear PSK identifier transmission

## Key Derivation (PSK Variant 1)

The PSK-based key derivation differs from standard EDHOC:

```
PRK_2e = HKDF-Extract(null, G_XY)
SALT_3e2m = EDHOC-KDF(PRK_2e, "SALT_3e2m", TH_2, hash_length)
PRK_3e2m = HKDF-Extract(SALT_3e2m, CRED_PSK)  // PSK incorporated here
PRK_4e3m = PRK_3e2m
```

Where:
- `G_XY` is the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman shared secret
- `CRED_PSK` contains the pre-shared key
- `TH_2` is the transcript hash up to message 2

## Running Verification

### Prerequisites
- Tamarin Prover (for `.spthy` files)
- ProVerif (for converted models)

### Basic Verification
```bash
# Run Tamarin verification
./run-tamarin-psk.sh

# Run ProVerif verification
./run-proverif-psk.sh
```

### Specific Property Sets
```bash
# Only sanity checks
tamarin-prover --prove --lemma="executable*" edhoc-psk-variant1.spthy

# Only confidentiality properties
tamarin-prover --prove --lemma="secret*" edhoc-psk-variant1.spthy

# Only authentication properties
tamarin-prover --prove --lemma="*auth*" edhoc-psk-variant1.spthy

# Forward secrecy
tamarin-prover --prove --lemma="forwardSecrecy*" edhoc-psk-variant1.spthy
```

## Security Analysis Results

The formal analysis verifies that EDHOC PSK variant 1 provides:

✓ **Strong Authentication**: Mutual authentication between parties sharing a PSK
✓ **Forward Secrecy**: Past sessions remain secure after PSK compromise  
✓ **Session Key Secrecy**: Derived keys are secure under standard assumptions
✓ **Data Authentication**: Message contents and transcripts are authenticated

⚠️ **Privacy Limitations**: PSK identifier is exposed to passive attackers

❌ **Identity Privacy**: No protection for PSK identity in variant 1

## Comparison with Variant 2

| Aspect | Variant 1 | Variant 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| ID_CRED_PSK Location | Clear in message_1 | Encrypted in message_3 |
| Privacy | Lower (exposed PSK ID) | Higher (protected PSK ID) |
| Early Authentication | Yes (from message_1) | No (from message_3) |
| Computational Cost | Slightly lower | Slightly higher |
| DoS Resistance | Better (early auth) | Lower (delayed auth) |

## Use Cases

EDHOC PSK variant 1 is suitable for:

- **Session Resumption**: Quick re-establishment of secure sessions
- **Resource-Constrained Environments**: Lower computational overhead than certificate-based methods
- **Pre-Provisioned Systems**: Devices with pre-shared keys from manufacturing
- **IoT Applications**: Where certificate management is impractical

## Limitations

- **Privacy**: PSK identity is revealed to passive attackers
- **Key Management**: Requires secure PSK distribution and management
- **Scalability**: Each pair of parties needs a unique PSK
- **Tracking**: Possible correlation of connections using same PSK
